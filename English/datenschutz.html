			Use of Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Instagram plugins

			Our website uses so-called social plugins ("plugins") from the social networks Facebook and Google+, the microblogging services Twitter and Instagram. These services are offered by Facebook Inc, Google Inc, Twitter Inc and nstagram LLC ("Providers").<br>
			Facebook is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). You can find an overview of the Facebook plugins and their appearance here:

			Google+ is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google"). You can find an overview of the Google plugins and their appearance here:

			When you visit a page of our website that contains such a plugin, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook, Google, Twitter or Instagram servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by the respective provider directly to your browser and integrated into the page. By integrating the plugins, the providers receive the information that your browser has called the corresponding page of our website, even if you do not have a profile or are not currently logged in. This information (including your IP address) is transmitted by your browser directly to a server of the respective provider in the USA and stored there.<br>
			If you are logged in to one of the services, the providers can directly assign your visit to our website to your profile on Facebook, Google+, Twitter or Instagram. If you interact with the plugins, for example by clicking on the "Like", "+1", "Twitter" or "Instagram" buttons, the corresponding information is also transmitted directly to a provider's server and stored there. The information is also stored in the social Network, published to your Twitter or Instagram account and displayed there to your contacts.<br>
			The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by the providers as well as your related rights and setting possibilities for the protection of your privacy can be found in the data protection information of the providers.<br>

			If you do not want Google, Facebook, Twitter or Instagram to directly associate the information collected through our site with your profile on that service, you must log out of that service before visiting our site. You can also use add-ons for your browser to completely prevent plugins from loading, e.g. the script blocker "NoScript" (
