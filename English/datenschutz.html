			Thank you for your interest in our online shop. The protection of your privacy is very important to us. In the following we inform you in detail about the handling of your data.

		<p class="small-title">
			1. Access data and hosting
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			You can visit our websites without providing any personal information. Each time a website is accessed, the web server only automatically saves a so-called server log file, which contains the name of the requested file, your IP address, date and time of access, transferred data volume and the requesting provider (access data) and documents the access.<br>
			These access data are evaluated exclusively for the purpose of ensuring trouble-free operation of the site and improving our services. In accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f DSGVO, this serves to safeguard our predominantly legitimate interests in a correct presentation of our offer as part of a weighing of interests. All access data will be deleted at the latest seven days after the end of your page visit.
		</p>
		<p class="small-sub-title">
			Hosting services by a third-party provider
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			In the context of processing on our behalf, a third party provider provides us with the services of hosting and display of the website. All data collected within the framework of the use of this website or in the forms provided for this purpose in the online shop as described below will be processed on its servers. Processing on other servers will only take place within the scope described here.<br>
			This service provider is located within a country of the European Union or the European Economic Area.

		<p class="small-title">
			2. Collection and use of data for the purpose of processing contracts, establishing contact and opening a customer account
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			We collect personal data when you voluntarily provide us with it in connection with your order or when contacting us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail). Mandatory fields are marked as such, because in these cases we need the data to process the contract or to process your contact and you can not send the order or contact without their information. Which data are raised, are evident from the respective input forms. We use the data provided by you in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b DSGVO for contract processing and processing your enquiries.<br>
			If you have given your consent in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO by deciding to open a customer account, we will use your data for the purpose of opening a customer account.<br>
			After complete completion of the contract or deletion of your customer account, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after expiry of the retention periods under tax and commercial law, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration. The deletion of your customer account is possible at any time and can take place either by a message to the contact possibility described below or over a function intended for it in the customer account.

		<p class="small-title">
			3. Data transfer
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			In order to fulfil the contract pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b DSGVO, we pass on your data to the shipping company commissioned with the delivery, insofar as this is necessary for the delivery of ordered goods. Depending on which payment service provider you select in the ordering process, we will pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution and payment service provider commissioned by us or to the selected payment service in order to process payments. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves if you create an account there. In this case, you must register with the payment service provider using your access data during the ordering process. In this respect, the data protection declaration of the respective payment service provider applies.<br>
			The same applies to the transfer of data to our manufacturers or wholesalers in the cases in which they take over the shipping for us (drop shipment).

		<p class="small-sub-title">
			Data transfer to shipping service providers
		</p>
		<p class="text">
			If you have given us your express consent to this during or after your order, we will forward your e-mail address and telephone number to the selected shipping service provider on the basis of this pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. a DSGVO so that the latter can contact you before delivery for the purpose of announcing or coordinating delivery.<br>
			Your consent can be revoked at any time by sending a message to the contact option described below or directly to the shipping service provider at the contact address listed below. After revocation, we will delete your data unless you have expressly consented to the further use of your data or unless we reserve the right to use your data for other purposes, which is permitted by law and about which we will inform you in this declaration.</p>

		<p class="text">
			In order to make visiting our website attractive and to enable the use of certain functions, to display suitable products or for market research, we use so-called cookies on various pages. This serves to safeguard our predominantly legitimate interests in an optimised presentation of our offer in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f DSGVO as part of a weighing of interests. Cookies are small text files that are automatically stored on your terminal device. Some of the cookies we use are deleted after the end of the browser session, i.e. after closing your browser (so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your end device and enable us to recognise your browser the next time you visit (persistent cookies). You can find the duration of the storage in the overview in the cookie settings of your web browser. You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and decide individually whether to accept them or whether to exclude the acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general. Each browser differs in the way it manages the cookie settings. This is described in the help menu of each browser, which explains how you can change your cookie settings.

The information automatically generated by the cookie about your visit to this website is generally transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. The IP address is shortened by activating IP anonymisation on this website before transmission within the member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.

The anonymous IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data.<br>
			Google will use this information to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services relating to website activity. This serves to safeguard our predominantly legitimate interests in an optimal marketing of our website within the framework of a weighing of interests pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. The data collected in this context will be deleted after the purpose and end of the use of Google DoubleClick by us.<br>
			Google Double Click is an offer of Google Ireland Limited, a company registered and operated under Irish law with its registered office in Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. (www.google.de).<br>

			Use of Google (Universal) Analytics for web analytics

		<p class="text">
			This website uses Google (Universal) Analytics for website analysis.
